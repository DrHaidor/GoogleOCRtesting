Using Lasers to Treat Kidney and Liver\nTumors\nThis is SCIENCE IN THE NEWS in VOA Special English. I'm Faith Lapidus.\nAnd I'm Bob Doughty. Today, we will tell about a new cancer treatment\nand a study of the disease malaria. We will tell about the possibility of\ndrier conditions in many populated areas. And we explain how cutting\ndown on wasted food could lead to energy savings.\nDoctors at the Mayo Clinic are using a process known as MRI-guided\nlaser ablation to fight kidney and liver tumors. They are said to be among\nthe first American doctors to use the process against the cancers.\nUntil now, doctors in the United States have used laser ablation mainly to\ntreat tumors of the brain, spine and prostate.\nLiver cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is also\nthe third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Many liver cancer\npatients are too sick to survive traditional treatments, like chemotherapy\nand radiation. Even if they could, medical experts say these treatments\nonly provide a small increase in life expectancy.\nEric Walser is an interventional radiologist with the Mayo Clinic in\nFlorida. He was one of the first radiologists to use the MRI-guided laser\nablation procedure to treat kidney and liver tumors. He says the process\nmakes it possible for doctors to target and destroy tumors without\ndamaging the rest of the organ.\nPatients are placed inside an MRI machine. They are given a drug to keep\nthem from moving during the procedure. A special needle is inserted\ndirectly into the tumor and light energy is passed through a laser.\nThe MRI machine can measure the temperature inside the tumor. Doctors\nare able to watch a monitor showing the temperature rising. When the\ntumor is heated to the point of destruction, the laser is turned off. The\nwhole process lasts about two and a half minutes.\n
