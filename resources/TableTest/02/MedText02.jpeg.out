Background
Allowing patients to access their own elect ronic health record (EHR) notes
through online patient portals has the potential to improve patient -centered
care. However, EHR notes contain abundant medical jargon that can be difficult
for patients to comprehend. One way to help patients is to reduce information
overload and help them focus on medical terms that matter most to them . Targeted
education can then be developed to improve patient EHR comprehension and the
quality of care . Objective: The aim of this work was to develop FIT (Finding
Important Terms for patients), an unsupervised natural language processing (NLP)
system that ranks medical terms in EHR notes based on their importance to
patients.
Methods: We built FIT on a new
Specifically, FIT integrates four single
views (rankers) for term importance :
patient use of medical concepts,
document -level term salience, word co-
oCcurrence based term relatedness, and
topic coherence .
unsupervised ensemble ranking model
derived from the biased random walk
algorithm to combine heterogeneous
information resources for ranking
candidate terms from each EHR note.
It also incorporates partial
information of term importance as
conveyed by terms' unfamiliarity
levels and semantic types. We
evaluated FIT on 90 expert - annotated
EHR notes and used the four single -
view rankers as baselines. In
Results: FIT achieved 0.885 AUC -R0C for
ranking candidate terms from EHR notes to
identify important terms. When including
term identification, the performance of
FIT for identifying important terms from
EHR notes was 0.813 AUC - ROC. Both
performance scores significant ly exceeded
the corresponding scores from the four
single rankers (P<0.001)
addition, we implemented three
benchmark unsupervised ensemble
ranking methods as strong baselines
FIT also out performed the three ensemble rankers for most metrics. Its
performance is relatively insensitive to its parameter . Conclusions : FIT can
automatically identify EHR terms important to patients. It may help develop
future interventions to improve quality of care. By using unsupervised learning
as well as a robust and flexible framework for information fusion, FIT can be
readily applied to other domains and applications .
