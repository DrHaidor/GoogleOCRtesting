Background
Allowing patients to access their own electronic health record (EHR) notes
through online patient portals has the potential to improve patient-centered
care. However, EHR notes contain abundant medical jargon that can be difficult
for patients to comprehend. One way to help patients is to reduce information
overload and help them focus on medical terms that matter most to them. Targeted
education can then be developed to improve patient EHR comprehension and the
quality of care. Objective: The aim of this work was to develop FIT (Finding
Important Terms for patients), an unsupervised natural language processing (NLP)
system that ranks medical terms in EHR notes based on their importance to
patients.
Methods:
Specifically
We built FIT on a new unsupervised ensemble FIT integrates four single views (rankers) for term
ranking model derived from the biased random importance: patient use of medical concepts,
walk algorithm to combine heterogeneous document-level term salience, word co-occurrence
information resources for ranking candidate based term relatedness, and topic coherence.

Results:
Partial information of term importance as FIT achieved 0.885 AUC-ROC for ranking
conveyed by terms' unfamiliarity levels and candidate terms from EHR notes to identify
semantic types. We evaluated FIT on 90 important terms. When including term

from the four single rankers (P<0.001).
FIT also outperformed the three ensemble rankers for most metrics. Its
performance is relatively insensitive to its parameter. Conclusions: FIT can
automatically identify EHR terms important to patients. It may help develop
future interventions to improve quality of care. By using unsupervised learning
as well as a robust and flexible framework for information fusion, FIT can be
readily applied to other domains and applications.
