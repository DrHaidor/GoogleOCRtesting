Background: Allowing patients to access their own electronic health record (EHR)\nnotes through online patient portals has the potential to improve patient-\ncentered care. However, EHR notes contain abundant medical jargon that can be\ndifficult for patients to comprehend. One way to help patients is to reduce\ninformation overload and help them focus on medical terms that matter most to\nthem. Targeted education can then be developed to improve patient EHR\ncomprehension and the quality of care. Objective: The aim of this work was to\ndevelop FIT (Finding Important Terms for patients), an unsupervised natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) system that ranks medical terms in EHR notes based on\ntheir importance to patients. Methods: We built FIT on a new unsupervised\nensemble ranking model derived from the biased random walk algorithm to combine\nheterogeneous information resources for ranking candidate terms from each EHR\nnote. Specifically, FIT integrates four single views (rankers) for term\nimportance: patient use of medical concepts, document-level term salience, word\nco-occurrence based term relatedness, and topic coherence. It also incorporates\npartial information of term importance as conveyed by terms' unfamiliarity\nlevels and semantic types. We evaluated FIT on 90 expert-annotated EHR notes and\nused the four single-view rankers as baselines. In addition, we implemented\nthree benchmark unsupervised ensemble ranking methods as strong baselines.\nResults: FIT achieved 0.885 AUC-ROC for ranking candidate terms from EHR notes\nto identify important terms. When including term identification, the performance\nof FIT for identifying important 
terms from EHR notes was 0.813 AUC-ROC. Both\nperformance scores significantly exceeded the corresponding scores from the four\nsingle rankers (P\u003c0.001). FIT also outperformed the three ensemble rankers for\nmost metrics. Its performance is relatively insensitive to its parameter.\nConclusions: FIT can automatically identify EHR terms important to patients. It\nmay help develop future interventions to improve quality of care. By using\nunsupervised learning as well as a robust and flexible framework for information\nfusion, FIT can be readily applied to other domains and applications.\n
