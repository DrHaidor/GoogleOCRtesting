Using Lasers to Treat Kidney and Liver
Tumors
This is SCIENCE IN THE NEWS in VOA Special English. I'm Faith Lapidus.
And I'm Bob Doughty. Today, we will tell about a new cancer treatment
and a study of the disease malaria. We will tell about the possibility of
drier conditions in many populated areas. And we explain how cutting
down on wasted food could lead to energy savings.
Doctors at the Mayo Clinic are using a process known as MRI-guided
laser ablation to fight kidney and liver tumors. They are said to be among
the first American doctors to use the process against the cancers.
Until now, doctors in the United States have used laser ablation mainly to
treat tumors of the brain, spine and prostate.
Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is also
the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Many liver cancer
patients are too sick to survive traditional treatments, like chemotherapy
and radiation. Even if they could, medical experts say these treatments
only provide a small increase in life expectancy.
Eric Walser is an interventional radiologist with the Mayo Clinic in
Florida. He was one of the first radiologists to use the MRI-guided laser
ablation procedure to treat kidney and liver tumors. He says the process
makes it possible for doctors to target and destroy tumors without
damaging the rest of the organ.
Patients are placed inside an MRI machine. They are given a drug to keep
them from moving during the procedure. A special needle is inserted
directly into the tumor and light energy is passed through a laser.
The MRI machine can measure the temperature inside the tumor. Doctors
are able to watch a monitor showing the temperature rising. When the
tumor is heated to the point of destruction, the laser is turned off. The
whole process lasts about two and a half minutes.
